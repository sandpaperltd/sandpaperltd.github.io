it's so hard to make mistakes. <br />

i'm not saying it's hard to do things in the wrong way, that's easy actually, the more you do, the more you try, the more you fail. and that's okay. but i forget about this on a daily basis, so this post, similar to the one regarding how good it feels to prototype, are about the same thing. more or less. <br />

no, i'm talking about how hard it is to restart oneself after a mistake, whether it's design or build related. or, even worse, procurement. when you need to buy stuff again because you designed it, or constructed it, in a inproper way. but it's necessary. or, better yet, it's unavoidable. it's not some deep philosophical thesis, rather, a message for future me to remember that, at the end of the day, we enjoy building stuff. and building stuff sometimes means breaking it along the way due to unforseen circumstances or, just plain mistakes and errors. would you rather keep your record clean, and not learn a thing or two about yourself and the project, or trade some parts, money and time for the joy that comes from creating? whatever that creation might be? <br />
