i had an idea for this blogpost for since middle of the december 2024. <br />

this was supposed to be a development blog after all, so where's all the development? so far we've done some personal stuff, some history of this and some psychological conversations about project approaches. but today i present grip-rev-a (i need to come up with a different name). <br />

![shtifuck-5-days-to-prototype-407](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e7d3e2f6-b7fc-411b-9137-1808ebe5a301)

(it looks soooooo goood). <br />

in the simplest terms it's a 3d printed flightstick grip (stick? joystick? a lot of different ways to call it, the manipulator?) attached to gimbal base of shtfck hotas/hosas. <br />

![5-days-to-prototype-008](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b3882e6e-0ebf-41ed-b465-edf305592e8c)

inspired (that's a bit of a stretch, but hear me out, even if look nothing like it) by f-16 grip has space for 3 universal pcbs (check the blogpost from 30th of december 2024, now it's all coming together) and can be mounted to the base with 2020 aluminum extrusion. insipiration comes from angle of the stick, and placement of buttons on the boards. f-16 grip has front panel with buttons for trimming the aircraft, weapon release. near the base it has additional paddle for autopilot, and of course there's a trigger for shooting guns. <br />

before we go the button functions on this grip let's address the 5 days part. i started sketching this on the december 9th and as you can see there's a note with five days later date indicating the idea (you have to believe me here, listen, i could post someone elses work and you would have no option to check it, so here, again, you need to believe me, i did this prototype in 5 days, more or less). <br />

![mainsail-log](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ffb832e8-972f-437a-87ab-c40e5527ca92)

and 5 days later i had first prints, with boards ready on december 15th. six days then, but five days for prints. so let's stick with that. <br />
