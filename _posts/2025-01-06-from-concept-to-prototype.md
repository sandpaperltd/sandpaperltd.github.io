i had an idea for this blogpost for since middle of the december 2025. <br />

this was supposed to be a development blog after all, so where's all the development? so far we've done some personal stuff, some history of this and some psychological conversations about project approaches. but today i present grip-rev-a (i need to come up with a different name). <br />

(it looks soooooo goood).  <br />
