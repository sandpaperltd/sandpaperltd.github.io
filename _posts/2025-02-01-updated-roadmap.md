it got derailed. of course it did. as always with plans like that - they don't survive first contact with the enemy. <br />
it's me, i'm the enemy. <br />

### updated roadmap

beyond, the updated roadmap. <br />

we (me and myself) at sandpaper ltd. won't be doing new revision of the gimbal stick. instead there is an idea to design and prototype yaw axis subassembly for the future force sensing stick. <br />

### _sidenote_
_sidenote regarding gimbal stick - it would be so boring to design it again, that the moment i started working on it, drawing models and contemplating the general idea i decided to abandon it, for now. maybe i'll get back to it, but for now it's dead end. i can't bring myself to working on something that i don't want to work on - it's hobby, pet project, passion project, side project, hovewer you wanna call it. i won't push myself and force myself._ <br />

look at my tiny baby. revision a. <br />

so, that's in progress now. as in during the design, printing and prototyping. on the backburner there's force sensing stick. maybe also in 25q1, don't know. <br />

okay, i don't want to be coherent. i tried the roadmap idea, it didn't worked fully as planned but helped to prioritize the projects and different ideas. i was kind of expecting that (derailing), it happened, i adapted to the changes and i'm moving forward. you should too. <br />
