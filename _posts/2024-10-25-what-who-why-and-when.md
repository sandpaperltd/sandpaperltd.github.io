so. we have it out of the way. this shit works, i have my font, i have my space. so what even is this thing? <br />

and i tell you, i hate it when people do that - when they add the question in the middle of the sentence - dude, just tell me. but this is a blog, and there are different rules? or, i'm setting up different set of rules for myself from now on. <br />

and it works on mobile too? outstanding. so - first things first, the ground rules. for now the most important one is to write everything in lowercases. font (comfortaa) i've chosen for this looks better that way. second. i don't know shit about grammar (there will be swearing tho), you can't expect coherent sentences from my side. i have somewhat broad vocabulary (or i hope i have), but i don't know how to use all these weird things like past participle or other present perfects. other rules? i don't know, enjoy yourself and stay silly while being true to yourself? <br />

now, to answer the question from the post title. this is the development blog for the shitfuck (or shtfck as stated in the first blog post, you can check it out later) project. hotas/hosas system for kerbal space program mostly, but works in dcs also. main goal of this project is to design, prototype and validate 2-axis joystick (that's already done), 3-axis omnithrottle (that's what I'm working on right now) and maybe in the future 3-axis joystick. i'll try to explain in details what all of those things are in the other blog post.  <br />

next. <br />

who? um, hello, my name is jacek and i'm the person behind the wheel. i have a master's degree in mechatronic engineering. in theory this means i'm equal parts mechanical, electrical (and software) engineer. <br />

okay, additional rule. there's no such thing as software engineering. there is not. not in my world. i've been hurt before by so called software engineers and this whole branch of make-believe so called engineering, and i won't let anyone hurt me again. it does not exist. one can be software developer or qa engineer, but in this household one can't be a software engineer. <br />

but in practice this means i'm somewhat fluent in cad design, dfm for 3d printing (mostly fused filament fabrication) and all that stuff. i know how to use soldering iron, but i'm not fluent in reading electrical schematics while at the same time designing pcbs? as i said, stay silly. and i'm silly. and i know how I connect a sensor to a microcontroller. i know almost everything one needs to know how to design shitfucks. i'm rawdogging my way through this as i go. <br />

but i do not know how to write code. i just do not understand programming. almost a decade ago i did, now i don't. <br />

okay, so you know who. next step. why? <br />

why in general and why here. <br />

simple answer would be to say that because i can. and i want to. but things are not simple. at the same time we're living in the age of wonders, where if one wants to, one can quite simply publish what one wants where one wants. i'm not that one tho, as mentioned before - i can't code. so i went with the simpler approach on hosting this as a repo. this way i can keep both the development blog and the files for different revisions. <br />

and why in general? because i like to create, and it may not look like that, but i like to talk about stuff.
