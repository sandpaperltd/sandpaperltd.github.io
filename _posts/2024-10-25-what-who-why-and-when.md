so. we have it out of the way. this shit works, i have my font, i have my space. so what even is this thing? <br />

and i tell you, i hate it when people do that - when they add the question in the middle of the sentence - dude, just tell me. but this is a blog, and there are different rules? or, i'm setting up different set of rules for myself from now on.

and it works on mobile too? outstanding. so - first things first, the ground rules. for now the most important one is to write everything in lowercases. font (comfortaa) i've chosen for this looks better that way. second. i don't know shit about grammar (there will be swearing tho), you can't expect coherent sentences from my side. i have somewhat broad vocabulary (or i hope i have), but i don't know how to use all these weird things like past participle or other present perfects. other rules? i don't know, enjoy yourself and stay silly while being true with yourself? 

now, to answer the question from the post title. this is the development blog for the shitfuck (or shtfck as stated in the first blog post, you can check it out later) project. hotas/hosas system for kerbal space program mostly, but works in dcs also. main goal of this project is to design, prototype and validate 2-axis joystick (that's already done), 3-axis omnithrottle (that's what I'm working on right now) and maybe in the future
