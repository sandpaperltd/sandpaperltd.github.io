this is my third imaginary company. i know how that sounds. first was one was active around fourteen to twelve years ago. it was a group project with name and logo coined together with other people. i'm no longer friend with one of them. we haven't talk for more than five years as of today. <br />

second one was active around four to two years ago. it was not a group project, but the name was suggested by someone that i'm no longer friends with. you see the pattern? one couldn't call me an entrepreneur. <br />

that's why this thing is my and my only. no external involvement in any aspect of the branding, naming nor designing logo. let's break this down segment after segment. <br />

shtfck project <br />
tangens rnd division <br />
sandpaper ltd. <br />

and let's go from bottom to the top, so in this case from top to bottom. <br />

shtfck, or shitfuck but without vowels is an homage to the meme from kerbal space program and monsters inc. about kerbals entering the craft ready for certain death. i guess i could say there was an external involvement here in the form of receiving this meme. maybe it come up during some conversation. but it stayed, and in it's shortened versions looks even better. in the meantime it got backronymed as stick holding tool featuring contraption know-how. <br />

tangens reaserch and development division is pretty straightforward. at least the rnd part. what i'm doing here is preparing prototypes, acquiring data and manufacturing devices that i'm later testing and after that reiterating whole process until i'm satisfied with the results and they're withing specified scope. shed rnd. and tangens is just the username for the ubuntu account with klipper installed to control my ol' reliable 3d printer. not a backronym, but it is connected to the project. if one were to look at the tangens graph they would see that on the left hand side of the y axis is in the negative values, and on the right hand side - positive. the graph repeats itself because that's how trigonometry works but the point still stands. let's consider one of the axis of the flighstick - pitch. if one were to push the stick toward themselves values from the sensor would go down, but the craft would go up. the other way around pushing the stick outward makes the values go up, and the craft goes down. the same as the tangens graph. sort of at least. also, the tangency constraint was extremely helpful during the design process, so again - a little homage. <br />

last but not least - sandpaper ltd. <br />

happenstance. needed a name for the laptop that's running ubuntu for the printer. back then just for running ubuntu. i don't know why, it just felt right. i've decided to go with the ltd. suffix because after trying other ones this looked the best. and while my skills, budget and abilities may be limited, it did not stop me before, and it won't stop me in the future. <br />
