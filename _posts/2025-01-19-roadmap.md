for once i have no idea how to start. <br />

hovewer. <br />

i need to do this, not becuase i'll forget (but there's a still chance), but to check if i can write something down and then proceed to do this - because it's my greatest curse. i write ideas down, i'll even put them into the kanban board, or some kind of a checklist, calendar, whatever. and they just sit there. forever. sometimes i'll go through them, but i get the dopamine boost from >>i should proceed with this!<<, and it's done. so, here goes. what if i prepare a timeline, of things i want to do, and then try to do them. <br />

### roadmap

will the roadmap help with that? i don't know, but it looks cool. and i can guide you through it step by step. <br />

### 25q1

plan for the first quarter of 2025 is to design, print and assemble revision g of the gimbal base, with modified cams, aluminium extrusions, new sensor boards - all the good stuff tested and checked during last 9 months since the release of the previous revision. standalone unit ready to receive new grip/flightstick/hovewer i decide to call it via updated/reworked teensy 4.1 breakout board. i need to take advantage of multiple i2c lines and have them ready for the future. <br />

should be possible? in theory? time will tell? i need to decide on the filament color, but i think i'll go with what i have now, use it all, and the buy new spool of something different? or the same? i don't know. i would prefer not to have to reprint the whole base because of color issues. but the black filament prints great. we'll see. <br />

### 25q2

with new gimbal base (hopefully) ready we can move forward to updated grip (hammerhead). inspired, or based, on f-15/f-18 sticks it should (hopefully will) have vertical - instead of horizontal - breakout boards for buttons, 5 way switches, hat switches, limit switches - look, i don't know what will be needed. the goal for this project, for this whole journey is to learn, to create tinkerable, easy to rework hotas/hosas setup for flying sim-lite or low fidelity flight sims, at least for now. it's enjoyable. anyway, back to the project. this stick should combine yaw axis mechanism from the omnithrottle (ąćł)
