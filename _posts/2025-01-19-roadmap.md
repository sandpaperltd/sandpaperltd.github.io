for once i have no idea how to start. <br />

hovewer. <br />

i need to do this, not becuase i'll forget (but there's a still chance), but to check if i can write something down and then proceed to do this - because it's my greatest curse. i write ideas down, i'll even put them into the kanban board, or some kind of a checklist, calendar, whatever. and they just sit there. forever. sometimes i'll go through them, but i get the dopamine boost from >>i should proceed with this!<<, and it's done. so, here goes. what if i prepare a timeline, of things i want to do, and then try to do them. <br />

will the roadmap help with that? i don't know, but it looks cool. and i can guide you through it step by step. <br />
