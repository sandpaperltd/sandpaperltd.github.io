it does. it really does. prototyping feels so good when you don't have a bitch in your ear telling you it's nasty (google that sentence and imagine it's me saying this about building stuff). <br />

i hate when people break design rules. absolutely hate it when something is not as should be based on the state of the art. but at the same time i'm breaking this rule almost daily when it comes to electronics because i'm still learning and sometimes, something that works but looks terrible is better than anything. <br />

solution to problem from the first sentence? don't look at other people projects that drive you mad. as simple as that. look at polished stuff keeping in mind that there are other ways to do what your heart desires. or look at all the projects and allow people to do it their own way at the same time sticking to your own principles. <br />

this blog post is mostly for me, to remember that what i'm doing could be considered as not-the-state-of-the-art. and it's okay. it gets the job done (the most important thing for any prototype at the end of the day). <br />

but, at the same time, i think i'm allowed to dislike certain projects, approaches, people (especially when they're unnecessarily mean or obnoxious). it's all human after all. besides - even this blog post looks like shit to someone better at this. but it gets the job done, it conveys a message as a part of my journey. frankly, why should i care then? and why should i care about how other people do their blogposts and projects?
